This is an experimental code for packrat parser on Boost Spirit Qi.

It is naively implemented, therefore it is very slow (e.g. 100 times as slow) for ordinary grammar.
However, complexity is limited to linear. It might be meaningful for pathological cases.

Though specializations and operator overloads are injected under boost namespace, Boost Spirit Qi source codes themselves are not touched.
If you want to try packrat parser, all you need is to include packrat.hpp, to replace rule with packrat_rule and grammar with packrat_grammar. If you want to use packrat_grammar, you need to include packrat_grammar.hpp, also.

I will add additional explanation later.
